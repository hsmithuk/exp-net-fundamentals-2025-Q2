Overview objective is creation of VPC with two subnets and then create Win2025 + Redhat + Ubuntu Server to link.

I decided to keep the same CIDR as instructor Tim  10.200.123.0/24, as that seemed sensible during the process.
I went with geographical name for the VPC 'aberdeen', as at this early stage I hope this helps with the learning and building out the solution.

Preview of the VPC showed as:

Post Create shows an additional entry under 'route tables'  that starts with rtb-

Found official documentation and 'rtb' is referenced:
